# flask-unity
simple flask media hosting and unity web image retrieval example for GCT700('21 Fall)

1. make "artworks_db.csv" with the image path
2. run python code "main.py" first, it will serve the image
3. run unity app: example code show different image from numeric keys above the alphabet keys

(python part requires Flask for hosting and pandas for data handling)

## TODO
* serve other info at the same time(title,artist, etc..)
* add searching features for the db
* add filtering features
